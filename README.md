# bigsqldump-importer
BigSQL Importer is a lightweight, AJAX-based PHP utility designed to safely import very large MySQL and MariaDB .sql files without running into PHP execution timeouts or memory limitations. This tool is especially useful on shared hosting, XAMPP, and cPanel environments where phpMyAdmin fails to handle large database imports.
